# GOAL
Add a **Books** tab to the existing bottom navigation, using the **`book-open`** Heroicon, and point it to the `/books` route (or the project’s equivalent). Do **not** create new screens or routes in this task.

# GUARDRAILS (ANDON)
- If file paths, icon imports, or route names differ from what’s assumed here, **STOP** and print the actual paths/usages you found; then proceed with those. 
- **Do not** add dependencies. Use the existing Heroicons setup and current nav/routing patterns.
- Make **no other UI changes** beyond adding the tab item.

# DISCOVER (READ-ONLY)
1) Locate the bottom nav component (e.g., `components/BottomNav.*`, `components/navigation/BottomNav.*`, or similar).
2) Identify how nav items are structured (label, icon, route).
3) Identify how icons are imported (solid/outline, import path).
4) Identify the route/key used for each tab (string path, route name, or stack key).
5) Check whether a `/books` route (or equivalent screen key) **already exists**.

After discovery, print:
- Bottom nav file path
- Icon import pattern (which Heroicons variant/path)
- Existing tabs & their route identifiers
- Whether a Books route already exists (yes/no; if yes, its identifier)

# IMPLEMENTATION (ADD TAB ONLY)
- Add a new tab item:
  - **Label:** `Books`
  - **Icon:** Heroicons **`book-open`** (match existing size/variant/style)
  - **Route identifier:** `/books` (or the router’s idiomatic equivalent)
- Apply the same active/inactive styling as other tabs.
- **Do not** create a new route or screen in this task.
- If no Books route exists, still add the tab but ensure the onPress handler navigates to the intended identifier. Then **print a note** at the end: “Books route/screen not found; added tab points to `/books` (or ID) and will need a screen in a follow-up task.”

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Bottom nav now shows a **Books** tab with the **book-open** icon.
- The tab’s navigation target is wired to `/books` (or the project’s route key).
- No new files or dependencies created.
- MyX (home), Reports, and Setup continue to work unchanged.
- Build passes.

# COMMIT MESSAGE
feat(nav): add Books tab (book-open) to bottom navigation

- Adds Books item to bottom nav using existing Heroicons setup
- Wires tab to `/books` (or project’s equivalent route key)
- No new routes/screens added in this change
