MyX Personal Dashboard - UI Design Specifications
Framework Foundation
Implements Barefoot Investor principles: Income → allocate Investments first (10%), then Emergency Fund (20%), then Fun & Play (10%), with Living Expenses (60%) getting the remainder.
6-Card Layout Structure
Card Arrangement

Top Row (4): INCOME, INVESTMENTS (10%), EMERGENCY FUND (20%), FUN & PLAY (10%)
Bottom Row (2): LIVING EXPENSES (60%) (hero), CURRENT SPENDING
Time Selector: Day | Week | Month | Quarter | Year (docked above bottom nav)
Bottom Navigation: MyX | Reports | Setup

Visual Hierarchy Rules
Hero Card: LIVING EXPENSES

Largest primary number (no secondary line)
ALL CAPS, centered title
Purpose: spending constraint (e.g., "You have $1,200 to spend on essentials")

Standard Cards: All Others

Primary number: current period value (large)
Secondary text (below, smaller):

Hierarchical context for 4 cards:

Day → show Week underneath
Week → show Month underneath
Month → show Quarter underneath
Quarter → show Year underneath
Year → show All-time underneath




Dual indicators: Color on number + status icon

Time Context Logic
Hierarchical Context (applies to 5 cards)

INCOME, INVESTMENTS (10%), EMERGENCY FUND (20%), FUN & PLAY (10%), CURRENT SPENDING
Secondary line shows the next-higher period total

No Context (1 card)

LIVING EXPENSES (hero): current available budget for essentials; no secondary line

Dual Indicator System
Color Coding (applies to the primary number)

Green: allocation executed (money moved to proper accounts/investments)
Grey: pending (allocation not executed yet)
Red: overdue allocation (creates urgency)

Status Indicators (heroicons)

Level 5: CheckCircle (solid, green-600) - exceeding targets
Level 4: FaceSmile (solid, green-500) - meeting targets
Level 3: InformationCircle (amber-500) - acceptable progress
Level 2: ExclamationTriangle (orange-500) - below target
Level 1: XCircle (red-600) - significant issues

Card Content
INCOME

Primary: current period income (salary, benefits, etc.)
Secondary: hierarchical context

INVESTMENTS (10%)

Primary: current period allocation to wealth building
Secondary: hierarchical context + total invested underneath
Example: "$200" with "Month: $800" and "Total: $2,450"

EMERGENCY FUND (20%)

Primary: current period allocation
Secondary: hierarchical context + progress toward goal underneath
Example: "$400" with "Month: $1,600" and "$1,800 / $2,000 goal"

FUN & PLAY (10%)

Primary: current period guilt-free money
Secondary: hierarchical context

LIVING EXPENSES (Hero)

Primary: available budget for essentials (rent, bills, groceries)
Secondary: none

CURRENT SPENDING

Primary: total spending in current period
Secondary: hierarchical context

Mobile-First Layout

6 cards: Top row of 4, bottom row of 2
LIVING EXPENSES card takes same width as CURRENT SPENDING for visual balance
ALL CAPS centered titles
Sticky header (personal account name; + Add Expense on right)
Time selector docked just above bottom nav

Personal vs Business Differences
Simplified Structure

6 cards instead of 8 (no tax complexity)
Focus on personal wealth building vs business profit
Emergency Fund combines safety net + debt payments
Fun & Play gives permission for lifestyle spending

Different Psychology

Investments = building personal wealth (not business profit extraction)
Emergency Fund = financial security (not tax obligations)
Living Expenses = household constraint (not business operations)
More permission-based language ("Fun & Play" vs "Owner Pay")

Implementation Plan (UI first)

Phase 1 (Now)

Style LIVING EXPENSES as hero (larger number, no secondary line)
Add secondary lines with placeholder numbers for 5 cards
Add neutral status icon placeholders (heroicons)
Keep colors neutral initially


Phase 2 (Personal Setup + Backend)

Personal financial setup: emergency fund goals, investment targets
Track personal allocations and transfers
Drive colors and status from actual execution
Replace placeholders with real calculations



Time Period Behavior

Day | Week | Month | Quarter | Year control period calculations
Living Expenses always shows current available budget
Percentages apply to whatever income period is selected (daily, weekly, monthly income)
