ðŸ“‹ Current Project Status

## Project Overview
- **Brand**: MyX (Financial Automation System) - "Find your X-factor in financial management"
- **Vision**: "The expense tracker for the non-accountant who gets things done: in work, play, life."
- **Core Value**: Not just tracking what you spent, but showing what you CAN spend (future-focused)

## Technical Stack
âœ… Next.js 15.5.0 with App Router
âœ… Supabase (auth, database, storage)
âœ… TypeScript throughout
âœ… Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
âœ… React Hook Form + Zod validation
âœ… Recharts for data visualization
âœ… Heroicons-master for consistent UI icons

## Current Architecture
- Single-org schema (organizations, expenses, categories, subscriptions)
- RLS policies for data security
- Basic authentication flow with email confirmation
- Dashboard with KPIs and expense tracking

## Key Issues Identified
- Organization creation broken - RLS policies prevent users from creating orgs
- Email confirmation workflow - Users go straight to dashboard without org setup
- Multi-org architecture gap - Current schema only supports single organization per user

## Strategic Direction
- Multi-entity user strategy - Support personal + business + social org expenses
- "Pockets" metaphor - Users can have multiple financial contexts
- Bottom navigation design - Mobile-first with MyX, MyBiz, Reports, Setup tabs
- Profit First methodology - Revenue - Profit = Expenses (not Revenue - Expenses = Profit)

## Dashboard Design - EXPLORATION COMPLETE âœ…
- **8-card layout** with dual indicator system
- **Delighter cards**: Revenue, Profit, Taxes, Owner Pay (with Profit First allocation)
- **Core cards**: Operating Budget, Current Expenses, GST, Taxes Due
- **Color-coded numbers**: Green (allocated), White/Grey (pending), Red (issues)
- **Smiley status system**: 5-level performance indicators
- **Context-aware**: Everything changes based on selected MyBiz organization

## Next Priority Items
1. Fix organization creation via API route with service role
2. Implement organization setup flow after email confirmation
3. Add multi-org foundation (user_organizations junction table)
4. Create organization switching UI
5. Implement the 8-card dashboard with dual indicator system

## Recent Milestones
âœ… Dashboard design exploration finalized with executive-level status indicators
âœ… Heroicons-master integration planned for consistent UI
âœ… Navigation structure updated (MyX, MyBiz, Reports, Setup)
âœ… Core vs Delighter philosophy established

**Status**: Exploration Complete - Ready for Implementation Phase
